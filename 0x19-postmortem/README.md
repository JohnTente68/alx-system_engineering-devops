Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
Issue Summary
Duration: May 30, 2024, 14:00 - 16:30 (UTC-07:00)
Impact: The user authentication service was down, affecting 30% of our active users.
Root Cause: A misconfigured database connection pool caused resource exhaustion.
Timeline
14:00: Monitoring alert triggered due to increased response time for login requests.
14:15: Engineer noticed high CPU usage on the authentication server.
14:30: Investigation began:
Assumed root cause: Database query inefficiency.
Investigated database logs and query execution times.
15:00: Misleading path: Focused on optimizing queries.
15:30: Escalated to the database team.
16:00: Root cause identified: Connection pool misconfiguration.
16:30: Incident resolved by adjusting connection pool settings.
Root Cause & Resolution
Cause: The connection pool allowed too many concurrent connections, overwhelming the database.
Resolution: Reduced connection pool size, optimized queries, and restarted services.
Corrective & Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Implement automated monitoring for connection pool metrics.
Regularly review database configuration settings.
Tasks:
Patch Nginx server to handle connection limits.
Add monitoring for database query performance.
Document connection pool settings.
